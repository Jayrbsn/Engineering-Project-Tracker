# Engineering-Project-Tracker

## Project Details

### Description:
For this project I was instructed to create a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”. Poised does the engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings. I was to create a Java program that they could use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

### Functionality:
This program is still in the early stages of its development and will be updated throughout the course of the rest of the bootcamp, however, right now the program allows users to create a project by prompting them to enter the relevant details needed to keep track of said project. The creating of the project calls the CreateProject method into the main Menu class to create the project object.

The user also has the option to change some details about an existing project such as the due date, the total amount of fees paid so far by the client, and whether the project has been finalised or not.

Additionally the program currently provides the user with the ability to change details about the contractor of a given project by calling the AddPerson method into the main class.

### Usefulness:
Currently this project is not useful because it is very incomplete, however, it has the potential to be developed into a legitimate project management software
